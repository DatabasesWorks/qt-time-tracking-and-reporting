# qtimemage
QTimeMage is a time tracking program that doesn't suck! 
Important qualities include:
1) Written in C++ by a seasoned professional software developer.
2) All events are stored using an sqlite3 database.
3) GUI is intuitive, and implemented using Qt5.
4) Effortlessly supports multiple clients, each with multiple projects, subprojects, subsubprojects, ...
5) Simple time sheet reports for week & month, stored in HTML format (easy to email).
6) Not full of bugs - I've been using it for several months, and it doesn't crash or do crazy things.
