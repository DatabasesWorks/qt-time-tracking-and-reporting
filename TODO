I'd like to implement the 'Custom Report' where it would be possible to select
one or more projects, and then pick the beginning and ending dates of the
report.

The database has a notes table, where the intention is to be able to associate
notes with clients and projects, and perhaps a start/stop/pause event. It would
be nice if to have this implemented into the GUI so it is useful.

A "connector" to an invoicing service, like the  offered by Intuit would make
monthly invoicing much easier
