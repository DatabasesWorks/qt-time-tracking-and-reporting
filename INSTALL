At this time you must initialize the sqlite3 database before running qtimemage.
You need to use 'schema.sql' and the sqlite3 command like so:

   mkdir ~/.local/share/qtimemage

   sqlite3 ~/.local/share/qtimemage/db <schema.sql

Now you can launch qtimemage. It should install an icon in your system tray with
a very useful menu. The intention of the GUI design is to used the system tray
icon when simply start/stop/pausing timekeeping, or switching projects. There is
no need to stop/pause the current project to switch to another, as the current
project will be paused automatically.
